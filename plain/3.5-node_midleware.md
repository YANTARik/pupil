#Middleware архетиктура.

Middleware architecture implies using modules to extend functionality.
We need to be able to add and remove modules without breaking something. 
That why our modules have to be independent. 
Imagine that we have several modules stored in an array, and our application starts using them one by one.

module1.next() -> module2.next() -> module3.next() -> module4.next()

Connect is one of the first frameworks that implements that pattern.

Example:

    connect = require 'connect'
    http = require 'http'
    app = connect()
    .use( 
            (req, res, next)->
                console.log('First middleware')
                next()
        )
    .use(
            (req,res,next)->    
                console.log('Second middleware')     
                next()
        )

    http.createServer(app).listen(3333)
