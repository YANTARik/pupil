http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9895202/what-is-the-difference-between-window-screen-and-document-in-javascript

Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window in most of the cases (in the browser);

window.screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

window.document or just document is the main object of the visible document object model/DOM.


    console.dir(window);
    console.dir(document);
    console.dir(screen)

Loading 

    window.onload = function(){
                alert('Hi');
            }


    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
