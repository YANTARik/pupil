##Scope

Scope is refer to the application model.

The $scope object contains business functionality of the application, the methods of our controllers and the properties of the views.

When the app starts to run it generates a binding from root ng-app element to the $rootScope.
This $rootScope is eventual parent of all $scope objects.
