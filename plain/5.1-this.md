##This

If we call the function from the global scope operator this will be the reference to the global object

    f = function f(x,y){
        str = 'my args: '+x+','+y+' this: '+this;
        console.log(str);

    };

    f(1,2);

But we can change this behavior by using call() method and change the context of function by passing object as a fist parameter. After that our object wil be assigned to this reference.

    f.call(0,1,2)

    f.call({},1,2)

    f.call(function(){},1,2)


Let's assume that we want to use the method of our object as a callback function.

    var myapp = {};
    myapp.color = “green”;
    myapp.paint = function (node) {
    node.style.color = this.color;
    };

And we pass this method to another function as a callback.

    var findNodes = function (callback) {
        // ...
        callback(found);
        // ...
    };

If we called findNodes(myapp.paint) the attribute this.color would not contain right value because this woud be reference to blobal object but not to myapp.
So we need to pass myapp object to findNodes function and then change the context of callback function using call() method.


    var findNodes = function (callback, callback_obj) {
        //...
        callback.call(callback_obj, found);
        // ...
    };


    findNodes(myapp.paint, myapp);


Also, we can pass a string instead of object as first parameter.

    
    findNodes("paint", myapp);

    
    var findNodes = function (callback, callback_obj) {
        //...
        callback_obj[callback].call(callback_obj, found);
        // ...
    };
