##Angular service vs factory.

http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/07/07/service-vs-factory-once-and-for-all.html

### Service

    var app = angular.module('myApp', []);

    app.controller('testCtrl', function($scope, MyService) {
        $scope.message = MyService.sayHello();
    });

    app.service('MyService', function () {
      this.sayHello = function () {
        return 'Hello from service!!!'
      };
    });

###Factory


    app.controller('testCtrl', function($scope, MyFactory) {
        $scope.message = MyFactory.sayHello();
    });

    app.factory('MyFactory', function () {
      return {
        sayHello: function () {
          return 'Hello from factory!!!'
        }
      }
    });
    


Well, you might see that instead of working with this in the factory, we’re returning an object literal. Why is that? It turns out, a service is a constructor function whereas a factory is not. Somewhere deep inside of this Angular world, there’s this code that calls Object.create() with the service constructor function, when it gets instantiated. However, a factory function is really just a function that gets called, which is why we have to return an object explicitly.
