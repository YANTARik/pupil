##Angular http service

If we want to retrieve information from the remote server via AJAX request we may use *$http* service. This service provide us with the simple API to make such requests asynchronously.  
This is a simple piece of code where we get some information from the server and save it into $scope object within our controller.

    $http.get('/contacts').success((result)->
        $scope.contacts = result
    )


This is an example of the POST request.

    data = {'name': 'Mike'}
    $http.post('/contacts',data).success((result)->
        $scope.contacts = result
    )
