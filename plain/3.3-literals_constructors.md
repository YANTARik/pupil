##Literals and constructors.

###Creation object with literals.


    // create empty object
    var dog = {};
    // add a new property
    dog.name = “Benji”;
    // add a method
    dog.getName = function () {
        return dog.name;
    };

You can change (redefine) and delete methods or properties.

    dog.getName = function () {
       return “Fido”;
    };

    delete dog.name;

You can add enother methods.


    dog.say = function () {
        return “Woof!”;
    };
    dog.fleas = true;

Javascript does not have classes but instead it has constructor functions. You can create your objects by using your own constructor function of using built-in functions like Object(), Date(), String() e.t.



    var car = {goes: “far”}; // using literal
    
    var car = new Object(); // using built-in function
    car.goes = “far”;


Literals are shorter and you have no reason to use the Object() constructor function. There is no advantage of it. Always use literals.


###How to create constructor.

    var Person = function (name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.say = function () {
            return 'I am ' + this.name;
        };
    };


    var adam = new Person('Adam');
    console.log(adam.say());
